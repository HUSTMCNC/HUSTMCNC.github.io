This event is organized by IEEE SMC Society of South China University of Technology and City University of Hong Kong. And it aims to provide undergraduate and postgraduate students with an opportunity to discuss their research results with researchers and fellow students. Through a tight review process conducted by famous IEEE Fellows, 9 best papers were selected to be presented at the contest day. Doudou Samb, a student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Electronic and Information Engineering Department was one of them. After presenting his paper entitled “Efficient Outage Optimization based on Selection between fixed Relaying Protocols for Wireless Cooperative Networks”, a certificate of merit was awarded to him. Doudou says: “I am very happy to be selected to participate in such activity”.",
