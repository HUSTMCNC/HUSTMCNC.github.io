	<p>On July 3, Dr. Yongmin Zhang from the University of Victoria, Canada, was invited to give an academic report on <b>Design of Charging System: From Perspective of Commercial Charging Station</b> at the A302, WNLO. Dr. Yongmin Zhang aims to solve the charging problem of electric vehicles and design the distribution of a city electric vehicle charging station and the pricing of different services with the goal of maximizing corporate profits. Dr. Yongmin Zhang abstracts the charging problem into an optimization problem, and gives a heuristic algorithm for the NP complexity of the problem. The students said that Dr. Yongmin Zhang's idea of mathematically solving the problem and solving it is very instructive.</p>
